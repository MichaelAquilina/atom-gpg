# :key: Atom PGP

Support for reading and writing PGP-encrypted files. Opening a PGP file will request that you enter your details using your key-agent, which will then allow atom to display the contents in plain text. Any changes made will be stored in encyrpted format using the same key used to originally encrypt the key.
